# Bachelor Project
This repositoray contains all the files and scripts used in the Bachelor Project: "Utilizing Machine Learning and Market Analysis for Predicting Energy Prices in Brazil.". 

## Project Overview
This project aims to create predictive models tailored to the Brazilian energy market, focusing on forecasting forward electricity prices. This involved:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing (Data splitting, outliers, missing values, scaling)
- Feature selection and engineering
- Selection of machine learning algorithms
- Hyperparameter tuning of models
- Validation and evaluation of model performance

## Folders
