# Bachelor Project – Forecasting Electricity Prices in Brazil

This repository contains all the files and scripts used in the Bachelor Project:

> **“Utilizing Machine Learning and Market Analysis for Predicting Energy Prices in Brazil.”**

Developed as part of the Global Business Engineering program at VIA University College.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to develop machine learning models tailored to the Brazilian energy market, focusing on **forecasting forward electricity prices**. We combined data-driven analysis with domain knowledge from a Danish energy trading company to support strategic decision-making in energy trading.

### Key Steps:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing (splitting, handling outliers & missing values, scaling)
- Feature selection and engineering
- Machine learning algorithm selection
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Validation and performance evaluation

## Repository Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `EDA/` | Contains Jupyter notebooks and visualizations from the Exploratory Data Analysis phase. Focused on identifying trends, correlations, and key predictive features. |
| `ETL/` | Scripts for Extract, Transform, Load workflows. Includes raw data ingestion, cleaning, and preparation for modeling. |
| `Algorithm_Selection/` | Includes evaluation of various machine learning algorithms, performance comparisons, and hyperparameter tuning results. |
| `ModelsInReport/` | Final implementations of selected models (e.g. LSTM and Gradient Boosted Trees) as featured in the project report. Includes configurations and model artifacts. |
| `Pipeline/` | Modular ML pipeline code for preprocessing, feature engineering, and training workflows. |
| `xdrive/` | *(Removed in public repo)* This folder was originally used for dataset storage. It has been excluded to meet data privacy. |
